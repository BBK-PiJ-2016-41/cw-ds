Please see the general comments, some of which are applicable to your submission.
The output of the various checking tools should be paid attention to although checkstyle is a little "aggressive".

See the general comments, re:

* using packages going forward
* using unit testing going forward
* javadoc and comments @see and @inherit
* Magic numbers vs constants (SampleableListImpl)
* returning true/false when the expression already results in a boolean

public boolean hasError() {
		return this.error == null ? false : true;
	}

* Internal classes that should be "package" access or, even better, "private" access
(e.g., ObjectPointer)
* Default constructors that do exactly what the default versions would have done
(e.g., FunctionalLinkedList)
*
